I did NLP, Generative AI, Computer Vision and the the way NLP works. How transformers work. How they are different from the conventional methodologies
Computer Vision uses convolutional neural network that does max pooling of the images by matrix multiplication (extract features) then those features are flattened into one 1 D array soon that array is used to do softmax to find similaritiy
There is a multi-modal models which works with captioned images 

Use cases: Image classification, object detection, Captioning. Tagging creating text tags for images

We can do facial recognition, object detection.
